### Hi there, I'm Jason Atallah ðŸ‘‹

I currently live in Northern California. ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸

I have been building APIs, web apps, automations and libraries with different teams and organizations in Silicon Valley and Arizona. ðŸŒŽ

I like to build distributed systems with TypeScript, Python, Docker, SQL and NoSQL databases, modern backend APIs (GraphQL, TRPC), and modern frontend frameworks (Next.js, React, Vue, Nuxt, Angular). ðŸ¤–

I'm currently dedicating a high percentage of my time to a limited number of organizations as an external consultant. If you would like to have my help with your team and product, feel free to contact me. ðŸ¤“
